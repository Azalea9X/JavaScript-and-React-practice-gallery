Hi! I am an aspiring full-stack developer, right now I am learning the fundamentals of JavaScript and React, with using SQL and MySQL as my database stack. I use some AI for help, mainly, I am following along with the Head First book on JavaScript, for their battleship project and using various extremely useful tips in my other projects.
